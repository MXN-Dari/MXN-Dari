- Hello, I go by Darí (they/she)(I'm currently a college student studying medical science. I enjoy taking language classes such as Spanish and Japanese. I enjoy many forms of media and entertainment but I want this blog to focus on enstars. 2wink is the main group I produce but I'm also a undeadp and edenP. Therefore I plan to translate stories that are relevant to them. However, I currently wanna focus on some of the 2wink stories from ! era since I don't really see any translations. I'm completely new to translating so feel free to correct me or tell me advice to make my translation better. Thank you for reading and have a good day :)
